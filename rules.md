HOW TO PLAY

A deck of tarot cards, major arcana removed, is
a dungeon. Shuffle the deck and draw 4 cards,
display them before you, this is a room. A room
ends when all the cards are folded.

Cups: Potions

A potion gives you health points equal to its
value, up to a maximum of 21 health points.

Drinking multiple potions in a row will make you
sick and result in no extra healing, only the first
potion's value will be gained in HP. Potions are
equal to their value and face cards (Page, Knight,
Queen, King) each are equal to 11.

Pentacles: Shields

A shield absorbs the damage difference
between the shield value and that of the
attacked monster's value.

Shields can only defend against monsters in
descending value and if you use a shield
on a monster with higher or equal value to
the previous, it will break. Broken shields
leave you unarmored, and taking full damage.

Folding a shield card will always replace a
previously equipped shield.

Shields are equal to their value and face
cards (P,Kn,Q,K) each are equal to 11.

Sword/Wands Monsters

Monster cards are equal to their value, and
face cards are as follows P is 11, Kn is 12,
Q is 13, K is 14.

You may escape a room. When escaping,
the remaining cards are put back at the end
of the deck. A player is allowed to escape
a room:

When all monsters in the room have been dealt
with, or when the player has not escaped the
previous room.
